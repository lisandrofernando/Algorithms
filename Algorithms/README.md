## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Big O Notation
# Time complexity estimates how an algorithm performs regardless of the kind of machine it runs.
# There are three different cases in time complexity: best case, average case, worst case
# O(1) - Constante time, describes the algorithm that take the same amount of time to compute regardless of the input size. Will perform only 1 operation
# When we have many operations in an algorithm, for example while loop, for loops, the complexity might be big O(n) linear time, input increases and time also increase
# Big 0(log n) binary search a good example
# 0(n^c) - Polinomial time, when number of operations doubles for the given input. Nested loops
# Big 0(2^n) - Exponential time, Fibonacci Series, running time means that the calculations performed by the algorithm double exponentially as the input grows
